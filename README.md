# Aim 

In this project, we aim to create a contactless water level indicator to fully embrace automation. The goal is to implement this system at our college, as our current water purifiers lack an automatic water bottle filling feature. Our plan is to incorporate a water level indicator equipped with a buzzer. When an empty bottle is positioned beneath it, the system will automatically fill the bottle until the water level reaches the sensor's position within the purifier. Furthermore, this project can be adapted for use in hospitals to monitor and detect when drip bottles become empty.Best thing about this project is we are implementing this all on riscv processor rather than arduino board .

# Requirements 

Here we are using *DFROBOT SEN0204* which is a Water/Liquid Level Sensor, Non-Contact, Digital Interface . This is a non-contact water / liquid level sensor. It utilizes advanced signal processing technology by using a powerful chip (XKC-Y25-T12V) with high-speed operation capacity to achieve non-contact liquid level detection.
No contact with liquid makes the module suitable for hazardous applications such as detecting toxic substances, strong acid, strong alkali, and all kinds of liquid in an airtight container under high pressure.
There are no special requirements for the liquid or container and this liquid sensor is easy to use and easy to install.
The liquid level sensor is equipped with an interface adapter that makes it compatible with DFRobot "Gravity" interface. Four levels of sensitivity can be configured by pressing the SET button.

## Testing

* Open a terminal window.
* Navigate to the directory containing the sample.c file.
* Design a function that executes the intended logic you require.
* Compile the code using the GCC compiler and verify the output:
  
```
gcc water_level.c
./a.out
```

## C code

```
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to monitor water level and control the buzzer
void monitorWaterLevel() {
    int Liquid_level = 0;

    // Replace these variables with actual sensor pins and setup
    int liquidSensorPin = 0; // Replace with the actual GPIO pin connected to the liquid level sensor
    int buzzerPin = 1; // Replace with the actual GPIO pin connected to the buzzer

    

    while (1) {
       
        //printf("Powered By Techeonics ");
        //printf("Liquid_level= %d\n", Liquid_level);

        if (Liquid_level == 1) {
            // Simulate activating the buzzer (replace with actual buzzer control)
            // digitalWrite(buzzerPin, HIGH);
            //printf("Buzzer is ON\n");
        } else {
            // Simulate deactivating the buzzer (replace with actual buzzer control)
            // digitalWrite(buzzerPin, LOW);
            //printf("Buzzer is OFF\n");
        }
    }

    // Clean up any resources here if needed
    // For example, you can release GPIO pins
}

void readWaterLevel() {
    monitorWaterLevel();
}

int main() {
    while (1) {
        readWaterLevel();
    }
    return 0;
}

```
